# Careers in Computer Science
## **Software Architect**
### *Career description:*
A software architect is a technical leader responsible for the design and overall vision of software systems. This role involves working closely with other teams such as software developers, product managers, and stakeholders to ensure that the final product meets the desired requirements and quality standards. Software architects have a broad and deep understanding of software development methodologies, technologies, and tools, and they use this knowledge to make informed decisions about the architecture and technology stack of a software system.

### *Responsibilities of a software architect include:*
+ Defining the software architecture and ensuring that it aligns with the business goals and objectives
+ Evaluating and recommending technology solutions and tools that meet the needs of the project
+ Collaborating with stakeholders to understand their requirements and ensuring that they are incorporated into the software architecture
+ Overseeing the development process and ensuring that it is aligned with the architecture and standards
+ Mentoring and providing guidance to other members of the software development team
+ Participating in code reviews and providing feedback on the design and implementation of software components
+ Keeping up-to-date with industry trends and emerging technologies to ensure that the software architecture remains relevant and effective

### *Required Education:*
The education requirements for a software architect vary depending on the company and the specific role. However, a bachelor's degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field is typically required. A master's degree in computer science or a related field is often preferred.

In addition to formal education, software architects should have a strong understanding of software development methodologies and be familiar with multiple programming languages. Relevant certifications, such as Microsoft Certified Solutions Architect (MCSA), AWS Certified Solutions Architect, and Oracle Certified Master, Java SE 11 Developer, can also be helpful in demonstrating expertise and knowledge in specific technologies and solutions.

### *Technical and Non-Technical Skills:*
    Software architects need both technical and non-technical skills to be successful in their roles.

### *Technical skills:*
- Strong understanding of software development methodologies, such as Agile and Waterfall
- Knowledge of multiple programming languages, such as  C++, Eiffel, Unix Shell, SQL/mySQL database, and PHP
- Familiarity with cloud computing and cloud architecture patterns
- Ability to design and implement scalable and performant software systems
- Knowledge of software design patterns and architecture principles
- Advanced knowledge of C and Java â€“ used for projects involving robotics, 3D graphics, software applications and app development
- MATLAB modelling software for signals, systems and digital communications processing
- Models and algorithms for data mining and machine learning
- Verilog circuit-modelling language, MIPS assembly language for embedded systems and FPGA circuit programming
- Software design models including design pattern and development
- Various networking tools including Wireshark

### *Non-technical skills:*
- Excellent communication skills to effectively communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Strong leadership and mentorship skills to lead and guide software development teams
- Ability to think critically and make informed decisions about software architecture and technology solutions
- Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to identify and resolve complex technical challenges
- Ability to adapt to new technologies and changing business requirements

### *Salary Range:*
The salary range for a software architect varies widely based on factors such as location, company size, and years of experience. According to Glassdoor, the average salary for a software architect in the United States is $119,000 per year. However, the salary range can range from $80,000 to $180,000 or more, depending on the above factors. With experience and expertise, software architects can expect to earn higher salaries and have opportunities for advancement into senior technical leadership roles.

### *Education*
The right education can make all the difference. Here is a great option for a post-secondary education. 
![Getting Started](./YorkU_Logo.png) 

    York University/Lassonde School of Engineering- Computer Science Undergraduate Degree
 
Requirements for admission:
- Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD)
- ENG4U
- MHF4U
- 4U math (MCV4U recommended)
- And three additional 4U or M courses
- A minimum math average of 75% and no math grade below 65%
- To gain admission to this program, your academic average should be in the high 80s to low-90s

First Year Course:
Course  |  Description
--- | ---
Research Directions in Computing | The course is structured around a series of invited talks by specific researchers and research groups, as well as a number of lab tours and other activities that will introduce students to specific research directions in computer science, issues related to professionalism and professional societies, and opportunities to become involved in various research and technical groups and computer science-related events.
Net-Centric Introduction to Computing | This course in computer science and engineering offers an introduction to programming. It introduces, in a net-centric environment, abilities and ideas including computational thinking, procedural programming, variables/control-flow constructions, event handling, and test-driven development (using HTML, CSS and JavaScript).
Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science | This course covers all the math prerequisites for more advanced courses in computation theory and/or algorithms that are not covered in the typical calculus/linear algebra curriculum. That is, it does not cover calculus or linear algebra, but it does cover discrete mathematics, logic, and fundamental probability.
Programming for Mobile Computing | This course introduces students to object-oriented programming for the first time and improves their comprehension of fundamental computing abilities like analysing algorithms, creating user interfaces, and using software tools. The basic concepts are exposed through a problem-based method, and they are then applied in an immersive laboratory. The underlying concepts are exposed and given context using a developed mobile software infrastructure (like Java and the Android programming environment). The goal of laboratory activities is to expose students to a variety of real-world issues in order to inspire computational thinking and provide context for the lecture material.
Differential Calculus with Applications | This course's math topics are directly related to what an engineering technologist needs to know. Differential calculus, which uses derivative formulas, is studied by students, although mastering the fundamentals of calculus comes first. The use of derivatives in technical word problems including linked rates, optimization, graphing, and velocity/acceleration/distance is the focus of this course. Students can gain first-hand experience with the applications of calculus through a multi-step project. By the use of algebraic and graphing technology, students are able to comprehend
Integral Calculus with Applications | The theory, methods, and applications of integral calculus are covered in this course. For students majoring in pure or applied science, it is the second semester of a two-semester first-year calculus course. Every university transfer science and applied science program's first-year mathematics prerequisite is satisfied by Math 101 and Math 102 taken together. Differential equations, transcendental functions, definite and indefinite integrals, techniques of integration, area, volume, arc length, improper integrals, infinite sequences and series, applications, and antiderivatives are some of the topics covered.

Keep in mind you need a minimum of 30 course credits and at least half (50 percent) of the course credits required in each undergraduate degree program major/minor must be taken at York University. This degree is a 4 year program. [For the program page click the link](https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/program/computer-science) 

### *Additional Opportunities*

Additional opportunities give people real-world work experience in fields that align with interests, talents, and educational requirements. Co-op gives you the opportunity to learn new skills and strenght while learning in the field of your choosing.
